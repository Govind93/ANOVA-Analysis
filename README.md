Introduction:
ANOVA is a statistical technique that is used for analyzing the differences in means in three or more independent groups. It compares the variance between-groups means
to the variance within-groups. However, ANOVA is conducted using the same five step approach. 

ANOVA Hypotheses
•	Null hypothesis: Groups means are equal (no variation in means of groups)
H0: μ1=μ2=…=μp
•	Alternative hypothesis: At least, one group mean is different from other groups
H1: All μ are not equal
Null hypothesis is tested using the F-test for all groups.

Objectives:
1.	Perform analysis of variance by hand
2.	Interpret results of analysis of variance tests
3.	Identify the hypothesis testing procedure based on type of outcome variable and number of samples
